# Particle Dataset

Welcome to the GitHub page of DeepTrackAI's Particle dataset. The Particle dataset is a collection of movies of optically-trapped particles used for training and evaluating deep learning models.

## Description

The Particle dataset contains 2 movies in avi format. Each frame is an RGB picture of a trapped spherical particle.

- **Dataset Size**: 2 movies
- **Number of Frames**: 100 frames per movie
- **Frame Size**: 120x120 pixels
- **Color**: RGB

## Usage

To use the Particle dataset in your project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the dataset into your machine learning framework of choice.
3. Train or evaluate your models using the dataset.

### Download via Command Line

To clone the repository and access the Particle dataset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/particle_dataset
cd particle_dataset
```

### Download Programmatically in Python

If you want to load the dataset directly into a Python script or Jupyter notebook:

```python
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from zipfile import ZipFile

# URL to the repository (modify this if the dataset is hosted in a specific location or file)
DATASET_URL = 'https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/particle_dataset/raw/main/mnist.zip'

response = requests.get(DATASET_URL)
with ZipFile(BytesIO(response.content)) as z:
    z.extractall()

# Now you can load the dataset using your preferred library, e.g., deeplay, PyTorch, TensorFlow.
```
