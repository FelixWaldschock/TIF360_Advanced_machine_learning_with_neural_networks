# Advanced machine learning with neural networks - TIF 360

## Aim
This course describes how neural networks are used in machine learning. Neural networks are distributed computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain, consisting of many simple processing elements that are connected in a network. Neural networks have revolutionised how we solve important problems in the engineering sciences, such as image analysis (object recognition and location), prediction, and control. The course gives an overview and a basic understanding of currently used neural-network algorithms, and exhibits similarities as well as differences between these methods. The main emphasis of this introductory course is on three connected topics: recurrent (Hopfield) networks, supervised learning with deep neural networks, and unsupervised learning (reinforcement learning). The goal is to explain how and why the algorithms work, when and how they fail, how to program the standard methods from scratch, and how to use packages that allow to easily set up and to efficiently run larger networks.
## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)
-distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning, explain the key principles of the corresponding algorithms, understand differences and similarities
-understand under which circumstances neural-net algorithms are the method of choice
-understand and explain strengths and weaknesses of the neural-net algorithms
-implement the algorithms introduced in class on a computer, both from scratch and using neural-net packages
-interpret the results of computer simulations and communicate conclusions in a clear, logical, and concise fashion
-understand the historical development of the field of machine learning with neural networks
-To have insights on ethical questions posed by machine learning, as well as possible risks, especially as related to gender and ethnicity
-To have an appreciation of the challenges and opportunities of working in an intercultural setting
